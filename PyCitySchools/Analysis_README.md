# Py City Schools Analysis

## Conclusions

### I. Effect of School Type on Academic Performance
Looking at our analysis of the Py City School system data, the top 5 performing high schools are all charter schools, and the bottom 5 performing high schools are all district schools. Furthermore, when we look at average overall passing rate by school type, charter schools have a significantly higher passing rate, with almost 40% more students passing both reading and math than in district schools.

### II. Effect of Per Student Spending on Academic Performance
Looking at the average scores and passing rates of each school sorted by per student spending ranges, there appears to be a pattern of higher passing rates with less spending. This may be because charter schools usually receive less funding from the government than district schools, and that fact combined with the greater curricular freedom and scholastic independence they enjoy incentivizes wiser investment of their financial resources. 

### III. District-Wide Trends
Students are doing better in reading than in math, and the overall passing rate does not look good at about 65%. As noted previously, the district schools, with overall passing rates around 53% to 55%, are responsible for dragging down that average. With this in mind, one way Py City School district might improve is by investing more in their smaller charter schools so they can accomodate more of those students that might otherwise fail at the largest district schools.
